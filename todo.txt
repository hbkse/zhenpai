current issues
    gotosleep
        sometimes the bot doesnt have permissions to give the role, dont want to give admin but can I just make this work?

potential stuff to work on
    gotosleep
        kick people out of voice in gotosleep when the time comes 
        need to add an option to dm the bot and force remove your role
        removing the role from everyone when the update loop closes? (should probably keep some of this in memory)
            guess this may not be an issue as long as the bot reconnects and scans the list again
        add timezone param option for gotosleep (right now everything central)
        move timezone handling code to a utils file (will need it for remindme stuff too)
    remindme
    codenames
    chatgpt
    can probably move the flyway migration into the dockerfile
